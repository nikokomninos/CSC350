      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Niko Komninos, and I'm thrilled to have you here! I am
        passionate about low level development, full-stack development, and Linux.
      </p>
      <p>My journey in computer science began when I was in middle school, where I started
        learning how to hex edit and modify exisiting games and software. I started doing some
        actual programming in high school, but became extremely passionate about low-level development
        in C, C++ and Assembly in college. Currently I am focusing on full-stack development for the
        purpose of getting employed, but in the future, my friend and I want to run our own
        aerospace engineering company.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently focused on web development, and I am learning software unit testing and deployment.
        I believe in living a purpose driven life. During the week, I find it important that I spend the day
        studying, programming or reading, and leave the night for leisure activities like watching TV.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of computer science I like to bike on trails (or just about any form of cardio),
        read, and am looking to trying picking up guitar again for the millionth time. I'm a huge
        fan of the band <i>TOOL</i> and want to play their songs.
