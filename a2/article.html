    <div class="article-abstract">
      <p>This article investigates the emerging evidence concerning the impact of prolonged screen time on
        cognitive function. Recent studies suggest potential correlations between excessive screen use and deficits in
        attention, memory, and executive functions. This analysis synthesizes current research, identifies key
        methodological challenges, and proposes avenues for future investigation.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The proliferation of digital devices and the increasing prevalence of screen-based activities have raised
        concerns about their potential cognitive consequences. While technology offers numerous benefits, it’s crucial
        to
        examine the possible downsides, especially regarding sustained engagement.</p>

      <p>Several researchers have begun to investigate the relationship between screen time and cognitive
        performance. Early studies focused on simple tasks, such as reaction time and visual search. However, more
        recent research has expanded to include more complex cognitive domains, including working memory and
        problem-solving.</p>

      <p>Despite a growing body of evidence, the field remains characterized by methodological inconsistencies
        and a lack of robust causal inference. Many studies rely on self-reported screen time data, which is prone to
        recall bias. </p>

        of Applied Psychology, 101(2), 123-145.</p>

      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>Our methodology involved a review of peer-reviewed literature published between 2010 and 2023. We
        utilized databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Search terms included "screen time," "cognition,"
        "attention," "memory," and “executive function.” We screened titles and abstracts for relevance before obtaining
        the full text.</p>

      <p>We focused on studies employing validated cognitive assessments, such as the Stroop test, the N-back
        task, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test.</p>

      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <p>The findings of these studies suggest a complex and nuanced relationship between screen time and
        cognitive function. While some studies report negative correlations, others show no significant effects or even
        positive associations under certain conditions. </p>

      <p>Further research is needed to disentangle the causal mechanisms underlying these observed effects. It is
        important to consider individual differences in susceptibility, the specific types of screen-based activities,
        and the duration and frequency of use.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The investigation of the cognitive effects of extended screen time remains a critical area of inquiry.
        Continued research, employing rigorous methodologies and considering the multifaceted nature of this issue, will
        ultimately inform best practices for technology use and mitigate potential negative consequences.</p>
