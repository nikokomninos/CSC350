        <h1>Trail Biking</h1>
        <p>
          Trail biking is one of my favorite hobbies. It's been a little bit since I've done it, since I've been pretty busy, but as a nature lover it's always a fun time. I've biked to Jones Beach a few times, which was a 50+ mile round trip. Along the way I had to pass through Massapequa Reserve, which was absolutely beautiful.

        <h1>Programming</h1>
        <p>
          If my blog doesn't make it clear already, I love everything about programming. I enjoy reading programming texts and documentation to always learn something new.
