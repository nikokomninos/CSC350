        <h1>Emacs: The Greatest Software Ever Made, and a Way of Life</h1>
        <p>
          Emacs is truly a masterful display of engineering. I've been an avid
          Emacs user for a couple of years now, and I'm always learning
          something new about it. For those not in the know, Emacs is "the
          extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor"
          made by GNU. It's been around since the 1980s and still has a large
          and dedicated community. At its core, Emacs is a text editor with a
          large set of keybinds for mouseless navigation, and a set of built-in
          programs that eliminate the need to leave Emacs. Emacs is extensible
          via a dialect of Lisp called Emacs-Lisp, and because of that, anything
          can be built inside Emacs. Due to the massive amount of tools that
          have been built to run inside Emacs, including a web browser and mail
          client, a common joke in the community is that "Emacs is such a great
          operating system, if only it came with a good text editor." While I do
          agree with them, since I replace the standard Emacs keybinds with Vim
          keybinds instead, it is truly amazing how many things you can do in
          Emacs. I program in Emacs, do version control with a built-in Git
          client, take notes in Emacs org-mode (a drop-in Markdown replacement),
          manage my calendar with Emacs org-mode, read PDFs, write papers with
          LaTeX, do remote development with TRAMP mode, and more. While the
          argument can be made to just use VS Code (which I do for web
          development, since it is just the best for that), the fun of Emacs is
          customizing it to do anything you can think of. This is the joy of
          open-source software in general. Emacs is extremely hackable and
          extensible by nature, and its only limitations are somewhat
          speed-related due to the interpreted nature of Lisp. Truly an amazing
          piece of software.

        <h1>Tiling Window Managers (Aerospace on macOS, QTile on Linux)</h1>

        <p>
          I love tiling window managers! Not many people outside of the Linux
          sphere know about them, which is a shame. Essentially, a tiling window
          manager automatically places your windows in a pre-defined pattern for
          you when you open them. In a traditional floating window manager, all
          of your windows open in random places on the screen, with random or
          previous sizes, and you have to move them all around with your mouse.
          In a tiling window manager, your windows are all opened in a
          pre-defined pattern, and are moved around with keybinds. I find this
          system to be very intuitive, removing the need for my mouse, and I
          always know where my windows are going to be when I open them. Tiling
          window managers also traditionally function using a virtual desktop
          system. Windows can be moved to different virtual desktop with a
          single keystroke, and adjacently you can move to a different virtual
          desktop with a single keystroke. It's truly ingenious.
