          Hi, my name is Niko Komninos, and I'm thrilled to have you here! I am
          passionate about low level development, full-stack development, and
          Linux.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey in computer science began when I was in middle school,
          where I started learning how to hex edit and modify exisiting games
          and software. I started doing some actual programming in high school,
          but became extremely passionate about low-level development in C, C++
          and Assembly in college. Currently I am focusing on full-stack
          development for the purpose of getting employed, but in the future, my
          friend and I want to run our own aerospace engineering company.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently focused on web development, and I am learning software
          unit testing and deployment. I believe in living a purpose driven
          life. During the week, I find it important that I spend the day
          studying, programming or reading, and leave the night for leisure
          activities like watching TV.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of computer science I like to bike on trails (or just about
          any form of cardio), read, and am looking to trying picking up guitar
          again for the millionth time. I'm a huge fan of the band
          <i>TOOL</i> and want to play their songs.
